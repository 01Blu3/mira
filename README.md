# Project Mira
Project Mira, a cyberpunk hardware hack presented for TreeHacks 2023

## About the Project
This project was inspired by the Arduino challenge prompt. "Create the best cyberpunk hardware hack"
There's alot of value in doing projects simply to learn and try new things, especially when they are abit more thematic.
We decided to go for a Search & Rescue theme, because when you look at how S&R workers outfit themselves, the style very much
lends itself to Cyberpunk!


## About the Team
This project was made by 3 hackers: Xavier M, Soma T, Ashley L
### Xavier
- I was in charge of the hardware portions of the project, more specifically the Jetson Nano and any ML integrations
- This was my first really working with Machine Learning, and it was very interested. 
It was very interesting to find myself out of my Depth, especially since the world of AI and electronics is so vast
- While I still have so much more to learn, I am definitely looking forward to going all in on AI and Robotics. They are some incredibly challenging topics, 
but I know that it will be a very interesting expereince.

### Soma
- I worked on the Quiz-site portion of the app
- This was my first time using ReactJS and making a real demoable product
- I learned alot, especially making something very product-like, starting from the very bottom in design to also implementing it in code
- For the future I'm interested in learning more about Full-Stack Technologies like React and NextJS

### Ashley
- I worked on the Quiz-site portion of the app

### Jetson Nano Code Packages
This is the source I used to start working on the Jetson-Nano project
There is much for a beginner to learn
